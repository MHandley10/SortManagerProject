# Sort Manager Project

## Purpose of project

The intent of this project is to produce a program that:
1. Presents a client with a number of sort algorithms (Bubble sort, Insertion sort, Merge sort, Quick sort, Selection sort and Binary Tree sort)

2. Takes a decision from the client via the Scanner method

3. Takes the length of an array to sort via the Scanner method

4. Outputs the unsorted, randomly generated array; the sort algorithm chosen; the sorted array after the chosen algorithm is executed; the time taken to execute the algorithm

## Items to complete

### Primary items to complete

**Bubble sort algorithm** Need to add in Bubble sort and implement it as an option

*Deadline = 18/03/2022*

**Binary Tree sort algorithm** Need to add in Binary Tree sort algorithm and implement it as an option

*Deadline = 18/03/2022*

**Merge sort algorithm** Need to add in a Merge sort algorithm and implement it as an option

*Deadline = 18/03/2022*

**Array generator with decisions via scanner method** Need to populate an array of no more than 1,000 digits in length, populated with random numbers ranging from -1,000 to 1,000 and ask for input using Scanner method to determine length and sort method

*Deadline = 18/03/2022*

**Way of timing the sort method chosen to give time taken** Need to time how long it takes to complete the chosen algorithm and return it to the client

*Deadline = 18/03/2022*

**Test the functionality and performance (speed tests) of the algorithms** Need to test the algorithms to ensure they work as intended and correctly handle erroneous inputs

*Deadline = 18/03/2022*
